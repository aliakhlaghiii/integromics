    "*Prognostic Value of Baseline and Pre-Lymphodepletion PET/CT Imaging in DLBCL Patients Undergoing CAR T-Cell Therapy*\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative treatment modality for hematologic malignancies, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. However, bridging therapy is frequently required to control disease burden during the manufacturing period before CAR T-cell infusion [1], [6], [7], [8], [9]. One way to measure the efficacy of bridging therapy on CAR T-cell therapy is through 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) imaging. Current literature predominantly focuses on measuring conventional PET metrics such as metabolic active tumor volume (MATV) and standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at single timepoints, rather than employing comprehensive radiomic analysis of dynamic changes [10], [11], [12] . The prognostic value of high-dimensional radiomic features and their temporal evolution (delta radiomics) between baseline and pre-lymphodepletion chemotherapy (pre-LD) scans remains largely unexplored in the CAR T-cell therapy context [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic goals\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to assess whether baseline, pre-LD or delta radiomic profiles (extracted during the bridging period) provide superior prognostic value compared to conventional clinical variables for predicting treatment response, toxicity, progression-free survival, and overall survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting point\n",
    "\n",
    "Current literature predominantly focuses on conventional PET metrics such as metabolic active tumor volume (MATV) and standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at single timepoints, rather than employing comprehensive radiomic analysis of dynamic changes [13]. Preliminary evidence suggests reduced MATV prior to infusion correlates with improved OS (Overall Survival) and TTP (Time To Progression) [12], [14]. Few studies have systematically assessed delta radiomic features, and almost none have explored high-dimensional changes in a CAR T-cell cohort [13], [15]. Bridging strategies (systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or combinations) may influence imaging dynamics, but their detailed prognostic impact remains unclear [16], [17]. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected results (Hypothesis)\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that comprehensive delta radiomic analysis will demonstrate enhanced predictive capability compared to conventional single-timepoint metrics.\n",

    "In the raw radiomics tables we initially had 99 features per patient, but many of these features contained missing values for a substantial fraction of the 31 patients. To avoid unstable models and complex imputation on such a small cohort, only features that are fully observed for all patients are kept. Concretely, any feature column that contains at least one missing value is dropped, so the final radiomics matrices retain only those features with complete data across all patients. This results in a reduced but cleaner feature set (44 robust features instead of the original 99), which is easier to interpret and more reliable for downstream modeling in a small-sample setting."

In such settings, highly correlated predictors can lead to unstable and difficult-to-interpret coefficient estimates, because the model cannot clearly decide how to distribute weight across redundant variables. Therefore, correlated features (such as height and weight with respect to BMI) are identified and considered for removal to obtain a more stable and interpretable linear model.\n"

In this dataset, the string `NE` is used as a placeholder for “not evaluated”, but if left as a raw string it would be interpreted as a valid category during one‑hot encoding and model fitting. To avoid counting \"NE\" as a real clinical state, all \"NE\" values are first converted to proper missing values (NaN), so that downstream cleaning and encoding steps can handle them as true missing data rather than as an extra category."

It scans through the predefined list `LABEL_CANDIDATES` and picks the first name that actually exists in `clinic_c` as `label_col`; if none are found, it raises an error to indicate that no valid label column is available. Then it creates `y` as a copy of that column and prints both the chosen label name and the value counts, so you can quickly inspect class balance and potential missing values, which is essential for supervised learning.[1]"

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "Despite our hypothesis that comprehensive delta radiomic analysis would outperform single timepoint metrics, the current SVM results do not provide robust evidence that clin+delta is genuinely superior. The clin+delta configuration achieves the highest apparent performance on the six-patient test set (accuracy 0.83, balanced accuracy 0.83, F1-score 0.86), while clinical and clin+A perform poorly (accuracy 0.5, balanced accuracy 0.5, and zero F1 for class 0) and clin+B reaches intermediate values (accuracy 0.67, balanced accuracy 0.67, F1-score 0.67). However, these differences are estimated on only six test patients (three per class), so changing the predicted label of a single case can substantially modify F1-score, balanced accuracy, and ROC-AUC, making the apparent advantage of clin+delta highly unstable and compatible with random fluctuations rather than a reliable gain. This concern is reinforced by the modest cross-validation ROC-AUC values on the training data (approximately 0.4–0.8 across scenarios), which do not translate into consistently strong generalization and are characteristic of overfitting and high variance in small radiomics cohorts. Therefore, while the present results are compatible with our hypothesis in the sense that clin+delta does not perform worse than the other feature sets on this split, they cannot be taken as convincing confirmation; instead, they should be viewed as a technical demonstration that the end-to-end pipeline runs correctly, with the true added value of delta radiomics requiring evaluation via more robust cross-validation on the full cohort and, ideally, larger or external validation datasets."

    "Given the instability of our SVM results on a six-patient test set, it is natural to explore an alternative classifier that may behave more robustly under the small-sample, high-dimensional conditions typical of radiomics. Ensemble tree-based methods such as Random Forest reduce variance by aggregating many decorrelated trees and have been shown to perform competitively with SVM in biomedical and radiomics applications, particularly when the number of features is large relative to the number of patients [22,24]. In addition, Random Forest provides intuitive measures of variable importance and can capture complex nonlinear interactions with comparatively modest hyperparameter tuning effort [23], which is especially attractive in our limited-data setting. Importantly, the goal of introducing Random Forest is not to overcome the fundamental limitations imposed by the small sample size, but rather to assess whether the observed instability and weak generalization are classifier-dependent or persist across fundamentally different modeling paradigms. For these reasons, the next step of our work is to implement a Random Forest–based pipeline using the same training–validation strategy and feature configurations as in the SVM experiments, in order to evaluate whether ensemble tree models yield more stable performance patterns and provide a clearer picture of the added value of radiomics and fusion features in this cohort [22,24]."

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "These Random Forest results are broadly consistent with the SVM findings and still do not provide stable evidence that delta radiomics clearly outperforms simpler feature sets. Both clin+A and clin+delta reach the highest apparent test performance (accuracy 0.83, balanced accuracy 0.83, F1-score 0.86, ROC-AUC 0.67), while the clinical model performs moderately (accuracy 0.67, F1-score 0.67) and clin+B performs poorly (accuracy and F1-score 0.33). However, all of these differences are estimated on a six-patient test set (three per class), so changing the prediction of just one or two patients in the confusion matrices ([[2 1],[0 3]] vs [[2 1],[1 2]] vs [[1 2],[2 1]]) would substantially shift F1-score, balanced accuracy, and ROC-AUC, making the apparent advantage of clin+delta and clin+A compatible with random fluctuations rather than a robust signal. The moderate cross-validation ROC-AUC values on the training data (approximately 0.6–0.8 for the better configurations) also fail to translate into consistently strong and clearly separated test performance across scenarios, which is typical of overfitting and high variance in small radiomics studies and reinforces that a single random train–test split is not sufficient to confirm the hypothesis that delta radiomics is superior. Overall, the Random Forest analysis supports the same conclusion as the SVM experiments: the pipeline works technically, and delta-based and augmented feature sets do not appear worse than clinical-only data, but the current dataset is too small to draw firm conclusions about an enhanced predictive capability of delta radiomics, which would need to be assessed with more robust cross-validation on the full cohort and, ideally, larger or external validation cohorts."

    "# Overall assessment\n",
    "Overall, neither the SVM nor the Random Forest results allow the hypothesis to be confirmed or rejected in a meaningful way; with only six patients in the test set, all performance estimates are too unstable for a firm statement about the true added value of delta radiomics. For both classifiers, the clin+delta configuration (and, for Random Forest, also clin+A) attains the numerically best test metrics, with accuracies up to 0.83 and F1-scores up to 0.86, which is compatible with the idea that adding delta information does not harm and might even improve prediction compared to purely clinical or single-timepoint radiomic features. At the same time, these differences are estimated on just three positives and three negatives, so changing the prediction of a single case would substantially alter F1-score, balanced accuracy, and ROC-AUC, while cross-validated ROC-AUC on the training data remains only moderate (roughly 0.4–0.8), a behaviour typical of small, high-variance radiomics datasets in which single train–test splits are known to give unreliable impressions of model performance. In this context, the results do not contradict the hypothesis that comprehensive delta radiomic analysis has enhanced predictive capability compared with single-timepoint metrics, because clin+delta is at least as good as, and sometimes slightly better than, the other feature sets on this particular split; however, they also do not provide robust evidence in favour of the hypothesis, since all apparent gains can plausibly be explained by random fluctuations driven by the very small test set and limited sample size, together with the known instability of ROC-related metrics and single train–test splits in radiomics. Taken together, the SVM and Random Forest experiments are therefore best interpreted as being consistent with, but far from proving, the delta-radiomics hypothesis: under the current small-sample setting, the observed advantages of clin+delta should be treated as suggestive at best and not as definitive evidence, and more reliable conclusions will require robust cross-validation on the full cohort and, ideally, larger or external validation data."
