    "*Prognostic Value of Baseline and Pre-Lymphodepletion PET/CT Imaging in DLBCL Patients Undergoing CAR T-Cell Therapy*\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative treatment modality for hematologic malignancies, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. However, bridging therapy is frequently required to control disease burden during the manufacturing period before CAR T-cell infusion [1], [6], [7], [8], [9]. One way to measure the efficacy of bridging therapy on CAR T-cell therapy is through 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) imaging. Current literature predominantly focuses on measuring conventional PET metrics such as metabolic active tumor volume (MATV) and standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at single timepoints, rather than employing comprehensive radiomic analysis of dynamic changes [10], [11], [12] . The prognostic value of high-dimensional radiomic features and their temporal evolution (delta radiomics) between baseline and pre-lymphodepletion chemotherapy (pre-LD) scans remains largely unexplored in the CAR T-cell therapy context [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic goals\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to assess whether baseline, pre-LD or delta radiomic profiles (extracted during the bridging period) provide superior prognostic value compared to conventional clinical variables for predicting treatment response, toxicity, progression-free survival, and overall survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting point\n",
    "\n",
    "Current literature predominantly focuses on conventional PET metrics such as metabolic active tumor volume (MATV) and standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at single timepoints, rather than employing comprehensive radiomic analysis of dynamic changes [13]. Preliminary evidence suggests reduced MATV prior to infusion correlates with improved OS (Overall Survival) and TTP (Time To Progression) [12], [14]. Few studies have systematically assessed delta radiomic features, and almost none have explored high-dimensional changes in a CAR T-cell cohort [13], [15]. Bridging strategies (systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or combinations) may influence imaging dynamics, but their detailed prognostic impact remains unclear [16], [17]. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected results (Hypothesis)\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that comprehensive delta radiomic analysis will demonstrate enhanced predictive capability compared to conventional single-timepoint metrics."

    "# Purpose of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "During this course project, we worked on semi-manually segmenting the lesions using PET/CT scan images, with the help of the lesion report, created by radiologists involved, for each patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this stage, we received the clinical data, which includes factors such as: age, gender, dates of important events, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, this notebook is dedicated to preprocessing, combining the radiomics data extracted from the images, and the clinical data, and then finally, running suitable analysis on them to test our hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results so far\n",
    "With 31 patients and about 170 features, after correcting for multiple testing of the univariate cox regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Survival** \n",
    "**definition** Time from randomization/treatment start to death from any cause.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "after correcting for multiple analysis there were no significant features left. \n",
    "Before the correction, we could observe that radiomic features from a time point closer to the start of the CAR-T cell therapy showed significant Hazard Ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Progression Free Survival:** \n",
    "**definition** The length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In a clinical trial, measuring the progression-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Also called PFS.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis showed similar results to OveralSurvival\n",

    "In the raw radiomics tables we initially had 99 features per patient, but many of these features contained missing values for a substantial fraction of the 31 patients. To avoid unstable models and complex imputation on such a small cohort, only features that are fully observed for all patients are kept. Concretely, any feature column that contains at least one missing value is dropped, so the final radiomics matrices retain only those features with complete data across all patients. This results in a reduced but cleaner feature set (44 robust features instead of the original 99), which is easier to interpret and more reliable for downstream modeling in a small-sample setting."

In such settings, highly correlated predictors can lead to unstable and difficult-to-interpret coefficient estimates, because the model cannot clearly decide how to distribute weight across redundant variables. Therefore, correlated features (such as height and weight with respect to BMI) are identified and considered for removal to obtain a more stable and interpretable linear model.\n"

    "Before dropping low‑value columns such as locations and free‑text comments and one‑hot encoding the remaining categorical variables, missing entries must be treated consistently. In this dataset, the string `NE` is used as a placeholder for “not evaluated”, but if left as a raw string it would be interpreted as a valid category during one‑hot encoding and model fitting. To avoid counting \"NE\" as a real clinical state, all \"NE\" values are first converted to proper missing values (NaN), so that downstream cleaning and encoding steps can handle them as true missing data rather than as an extra category."
