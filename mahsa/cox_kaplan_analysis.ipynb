    "*Prognostic Value of Baseline and Pre-Lymphodepletion PET/CT Imaging in DLBCL Patients Undergoing CAR T-Cell Therapy*\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative treatment modality for hematologic malignancies, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. However, bridging therapy is frequently required to control disease burden during the manufacturing period before CAR T-cell infusion [1], [6], [7], [8], [9]. One way to measure the efficacy of bridging therapy on CAR T-cell therapy is through 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) imaging. Current literature predominantly focuses on measuring conventional PET metrics such as metabolic active tumor volume (MATV) and standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at single timepoints, rather than employing comprehensive radiomic analysis of dynamic changes [10], [11], [12] . The prognostic value of high-dimensional radiomic features and their temporal evolution (delta radiomics) between baseline and pre-lymphodepletion chemotherapy (pre-LD) scans remains largely unexplored in the CAR T-cell therapy context [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic goals\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to assess whether baseline, pre-LD or delta radiomic profiles (extracted during the bridging period) provide superior prognostic value compared to conventional clinical variables for predicting treatment response, toxicity, progression-free survival, and overall survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting point\n",
    "\n",
    "Current literature predominantly focuses on conventional PET metrics such as metabolic active tumor volume (MATV) and standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at single timepoints, rather than employing comprehensive radiomic analysis of dynamic changes [13]. Preliminary evidence suggests reduced MATV prior to infusion correlates with improved OS (Overall Survival) and TTP (Time To Progression) [12], [14]. Few studies have systematically assessed delta radiomic features, and almost none have explored high-dimensional changes in a CAR T-cell cohort [13], [15]. Bridging strategies (systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or combinations) may influence imaging dynamics, but their detailed prognostic impact remains unclear [16], [17]. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected results (Hypothesis)\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that comprehensive delta radiomic analysis will demonstrate enhanced predictive capability compared to conventional single-timepoint metrics."

    "# Purpose of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "During this course project, we worked on semi-manually segmenting the lesions using PET/CT scan images, with the help of the lesion report, created by radiologists involved, for each patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this stage, we received the clinical data, which includes factors such as: age, gender, dates of important events, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, this notebook is dedicated to preprocessing, combining the radiomics data extracted from the images, and the clinical data, and then finally, running suitable analysis on them to test our hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results so far\n",
    "With 28 patients and about 170 features, after correcting for multiple testing of the univariate cox regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Survival** \n",
    "**definition** Time from randomization/treatment start to death from any cause.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "after correcting for multiple analysis there were no significant features left. \n",
    "Before the correction, we could observe that radiomic features from a time point closer to the start of the CAR-T cell therapy showed significant Hazard Ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Progression Free Survival:** \n",
    "**definition** The length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In a clinical trial, measuring the progression-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Also called PFS.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis showed similar results to OveralSurvival\n",

    "\n",
    "HR > 1: Increased hazard (risk). The event is more likely in the group coded \"1\" or for higher values of the variable. For example, HR = 1.5 means a 50% higher risk.​\n",

    "\n",
    "## What Is the Hazard?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The hazard rate** is the *instantaneous risk* of the event (like death) happening **at a particular time**, *given that the person has survived up until that time*.\n",
    "    - In formulas: \n",
    "     h(t) = chance event(e.g. death) occurs right after time *t* / chance survived up to time *t*.\n",
    "    - It is measured *per unit time* (e.g., per month or per year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as **the event rate among those still at risk**, *right now*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each group (treatment vs control), you can estimate the hazard rate over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cox regression, the hazard ratio (HR) describes how the hazard—the instantaneous rate of the event occurring—changes with a one-unit increase in a given feature, assuming all other variables are held constant\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Does the Hazard Ratio (HR) Tell You?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **hazard ratio** compares the *hazard rates* between two groups:\n",
    "    - HR = hazard in group 1 / hazard in group 0.\n",
    "- For example, if HR = 2:\n",
    "    - The event (death) happens **twice as quickly** (per unit time) in treatment as in control.\n",
    "- If HR = 0.5:\n",
    "    - The event happens **half as quickly** in the group coded as 1(treatment) compared to the group coded as 0(control).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Continuous Feature in Cox Regression, Hazard for continuous features\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose age is your feature, and your model estimates β=0.04\n",
    "Then, HR=exp(0.04)≈1.04\n",
    "HR=exp(0.04)≈1.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Each additional year of age is associated with a 4% higher hazard (risk of event, e.g., death).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a continuous variable (like albumin level), the Cox regression estimates the effect per unit increase in that variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hazard ratio (HR) is calculated as exp(β), where β is the regression coefficient.\n",
    "If β<0, then exp(β) falls between 0 and 1.​\n",
    "\n",
    "What does HR < 1 mean for a continuous variable?\n",
    "An HR < 1 means that as the value of your variable increases, the hazard (risk) of the event decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every one unit increase (e.g., each point higher albumin), the risk of the event happening goes down by a factor of the hazard ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hazard ≠ cumulative risk. The *hazard* is about the **rate at which events are happening at a specific instant**.\n",
    "- **Kaplan–Meier curves** can show the cumulative risk (probability) but the hazard is about the *slope* or how quickly the curve drops.\n",
    "- Cox regression estimates how covariates (like treatment) influence this rate, assuming the ratio (HR) is the same at all times (*proportional hazards*).\n",

    "# Kaplan-Meier Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "A Kaplan-Meier curve shows the estimated probability of “survival” or remaining event-free over time for a group of subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What the plot shows\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **horizontal axis** represents time (e.g., months, years).\n",
    "- The **vertical axis** shows the estimated probability of survival or event-free status — starting at 1 (100%) at time zero and decreasing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to interpret the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **downward step** occurs when an event (e.g., death, relapse) happens, reflecting a drop in survival probability.\n",
    "- **Horizontal plateaus** indicate periods with no events, where survival is stable.\n",
    "- The **steepness** of the slope matters: a steeper downward step means a higher event rate (worse survival); a flatter curve means better survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding survival probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- At any time point on the curve, the vertical value is the estimated probability of still surviving beyond that time.\n",
    "- For example, if at 12 months the curve is at 0.85, it means an estimated 85% of subjects survive at least 12 months, or 15% have experienced the event by then.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How each drop is calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "For each distinct event time \\(t\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let \\(n_t\\) be the number of patients “at risk” just before time \\(t\\) (alive patients).  \n",
    "2. Let \\(d_t\\) be the number of deaths at time \\(t\\).  \n",
    "3. The conditional survival at that time is  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   1 - \\frac{d_t}{n_t}\n",
    "   $$  \n",
    "4. The KM survival estimate after that time is the product of all previous conditional survivals:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\hat S(t) = \\prod_{u \\le t} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_u}{n_u}\\right)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the size of each vertical drop equals multiplying the previous survival probability by \\(1 - d_t/n_t\\); more deaths or fewer patients at risk at that time produce a larger visible drop. Censored patients (those lost to follow‑up or still alive at last contact) simply reduce the future risk set at the time they are censored and do not cause any drop in the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Censoring** is shown by tick marks on the plot; those subjects were lost or event-free at last follow-up.\n",
    "- Comparing two or more groups' curves helps to visualize differences in survival between treatments or populations, often supplemented by statistical tests.\n",
    "- The curve is a step function estimating the survival function over time, useful for medical or reliability studies, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization helps understand how quickly events occur over time and estimate median survival times or probabilities at specific time points."

    "The OS Kaplan–Meier (KM) curve shows how the probability of being alive decreases over time, with each downward step representing one or more deaths among the patients under follow‑up at that time. The shaded area is a confidence interval indicating uncertainty around the estimated survival probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical interpretation:**  \n",
    "Clinically, this curve suggests that overall survival in this cohort declines steadily over the follow‑up period, with a substantial proportion of patients dying within the first few years after the starting point.\n"

    "The steep initial drop in survival probability means a high rate of PFS events (progression or death) soon after treatment.​\n",
    "\n",
    "The later plateau (curve nearly flat) means that among patients who remain event‑free past that point, relatively few additional progressions/deaths occur over follow‑up.​\n",

    "Early after CAR T, a substantial fraction of patients progress or die.​\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients who are still progression‑free after that early high‑risk window appear to have more durable disease control, reflected by the flatter tail of the curve."
